# Primitives proposed to fill core language gaps in Dyalog APL

In Dyalog 18.2 or higher:
`]get /path/to/repo -u`

Now use:

* `X Ⓓ Y` (`X D̲ Y`) for `X⊇Y` which is the [Select function](https://aplwiki.com/wiki/From)
* `f Ö g` for `f⍥g` which is the [Depth operator](https://dfns.dyalog.com/n_Depth.htm)
* `f Ⓞ g` (`f O̲ g`) for `f⍛g` which is the [Behind operator](https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Reverse_Compose)
